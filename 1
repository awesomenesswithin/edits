hi! we are a Be’Cause! Be’Cause is a youth organisation founded by youths, for youths, to raise awareness about current affairs and issues affecting the society to be able to make meaningful and informed changes for our future. we believe that in order to make any changes, knowledge is key. we write articles for our e-zines, we offer volunteering opportunities and share bit size news sharing through our telegram groupchat! we feel that many teenagers aren’t interested in reading news published by Straits Times or CNA because of how lengthy it is, hence, we provide summaries for them daily! In addition, if you would like to join us, our executive committee is open for everyone aged 16-23! we have many different roles that will enable you to sharpen your skills such as editing, writing, designing and many more. the recent volunteering we did was the Wynist coastal cleanup at east coast park in collaboration with Temasek Polytechnic’s GIG and Boy’s Scouts Association Singapore. After that, we published an e-zine solely focusing on the environment. We cover broad ideas down to the niche ones. A well-informed youth is able to make changes, even a little, for the future of society
