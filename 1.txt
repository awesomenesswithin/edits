Hi, welcome to our booth!

Be’Cause is a youth organisation founded by youths, for youths.
We believe that knowledge is key in preparing youths to form the future of our society.

Hence, raising awareness about current affairs and issues affecting the society is central to what we do.
The aim is for our readers to be able to make meaningful and informed changes for our future.

On the daily, we share a curated collection of bite-sized news summaries through our telegram channel, as well as publish a monthly digest through our e-zine.

Since teenagers generally share the sentiment that they are disinterested in reading articles published by Straits Times or CNA because of how lengthy they are, our summaries effectively engage them and serve as an avenue to spur their interest in current affairs. 

From broad ideas down to the niche ones, a well-informed youth is empowered to drive change for the better; and every little snippet of info serves to equip them better for the future society.

In addition, we offer volunteering opportunities as well, and our executive committee is currently recruiting! Everyone aged 16-23 is free to apply to take on a variety of roles that will enable you to sharpen your skills in editing, writing, designing and many more. Please fill in our recruitment form if you are interested in joining the team, thank you!



Possible questions:
Q1: What are some of the external volunteering opportunities available, apart from publication related roles? How does this relate to the mission of Be'Cause?
A1: A recent activity volunteers were able to participate in was the Wynist coastal cleanup at east coast park in collaboration with Temasek Polytechnic’s Green Interest Group (GIG) and The Singapore Scouts Association. Afterwards, we published a follow-up e-zine focused on environmental issues.
